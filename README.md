# Sinatra State Tracker

Welcome to the MVC Sinatra State Tracker application, built using CRUD & Active Record! Upon install, you will have access to an application that allows users to uniquely log in and keep track of the states in the US they have traveled to. In addition, they can add a favorite memory of each state, as well as, update & delete this memory. The individual states can also be deleted from their state lists. The number of states all other users have visited can be viewed as well. Enjoy!
